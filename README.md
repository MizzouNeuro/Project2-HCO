# Project2-HCO

You are to design a two-cell half center oscillator using NEURON, starting with the NEURON templates provided to you in the zipped folder ‘HCO_Startup files’.  As part of the project, you are to perform appropriate literature survey*, understand the relevant concepts, and ‘define’ your problem, i.e., all aspects related to how you develop your model.
